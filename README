Web Authentication
==================

An example of stateful session based authentication, talking
between two different servers, Golang and any front-end.

Any stand-alone front-end can communicate with the Go server,
thanks to Javascript.

This implementation will still be valid if you decided to only
deploy the user interface by just a simple templating language,
assuming you know what you're doing.

1) Database Mocking
-------------------

Why not use real database?

Because it is easier to just mock it, no need to install or setup
anything. The project is simple enough, you can just delete the
db/ folder and configure your own SQL/NoSQL database.

2) User Interface
-----------------

Front-end stuff is at folder www/ use any servers like:

    - Serve by Vercel <https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve>
    - Python HTTP Server <https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html>

I happen to use Python's HTTP Server, to start the front-end
server:

    ./www/run.sh

It should be listening at port 8000.

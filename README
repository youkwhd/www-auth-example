Web Authentication
==================

DISCLAIMER: THIS PROJECT IS NOT COMPLETED YET, THIS REPO IS
PUBLICLY AVAILABLE FROM THE FIRST COMMIT.

An example of stateful session based authentication, talking
between two different servers, Golang and any front-end.

User Interface
--------------

Front-end stuff is at folder www/ use any servers like:

    - Serve by Vercel <https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve>
    - Python HTTP Server <https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html>

I happen to use Python's HTTP Server, to start the front-end
server:

    ./www/run.sh

It should be listening at port 8000.
